## 29 June 2025
- Completed the first 4 chapters and started chapter 5 of [Tour of Rust]("https://tourofrust.com/index.html"). Remembered concepts learned at the lab (variable types and conversions, control flow structures) while discovering things I missed the first time around (technicalities surrounding returning and variables' lifecycles). 
- Installed [Rustlings]("https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/").
