Went through Lab 00 from MA to ensure I learned correctly.
Then, I began doing Rustlings, first exercises went smoothly.
## 2 July 2025
Continued Rustlings, till hashmaps, I didn't struggle as much, thats when exercises started increasing in difficulty.
## 3 July 2025
I managed to get to iterators, some of the exercises were a bit difficult but It was okay overall.
## 4 July 2025
Finished Rustlings and managed to flash Stm32f4 evem though initially the probe wasn't detected despite it appearing in the usb list. With some guidance, I managed to get it resolved by updating udev rules and config.toml file file.

I went through the MA labs starting from 2, I struggled a bit with the last exercise as the lights didn't turn on according to how it was required in the exercise (3 lights on for a dash and 1 light for a dot) but this was due to not adding a timer future function after each character reading, leading to inconsistencies. For the rest of the labs, I encountered similar issues but I managed to comprehend the most part and didn't find any significant difficulty compared to solving them and flashing them on Raspberry Pi.
