Finished Rustlings

Started working on the STM32
Made leds blink using gpio lab

Assigned fisrt task:

Implement 8042 peripheral
#23


Must install Linux in order to continue

## --03/07/2025--
Made progress.. ... ...

1. Dual booted my PC. WE HAVE UBUNTU AND WINDOWS YIPPEE!
2. Installed tockloader on linux
3. went through libtock-rs (didn't work) and then tried libtock-c and flashed on the nucleof429
the STM32 is blinking now thanks to tockloader


Additional steps:
-Customised VS Code to my liking on linux too
-Fixed issue with SSD
-Other set-ups necessary for linux
-installed rust on linux


## --04/07/2025--

Woring on the kernel system
Having trouble with "Can't find crate for 'test'
So far I finished going through the fisrt chapter of making a kernel
I have fixed some basic issues.

I will come with updates

## --08/07/2025--

Kernel system in rust: added keyboard reader
Bug found: Cannot compile with latest rustc nightly 1.90.0
Works: 1.88.0 nightly 

Must finish the kernel in order to convert into tock
