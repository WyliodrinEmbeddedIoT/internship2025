I started Tour of Rust and Rustlings, got about halfway through both of them

## 1 July 2025
Continued with Rustlings and tour of rust

## 2 July 2025
I finished Rustling and Tour of Rust, then I started working on the STM labs

## 3 July 2025
I chose my first task, implement yield_wait_for and I started working on it

## 4 July 2025
Managed to implement the function, began testing and I came across a bug in the kernel.
I made pull requests for both the kernel and the function.

## 7 July 2025
I made the changes requested on my pull request and began working on the ProcessConsole task
