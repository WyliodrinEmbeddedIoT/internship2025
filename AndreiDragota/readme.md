During the day I recapped most of Rust's programming language intrinsics by going through https://tourofrust.com/TOC_en.html, finished 8 chapters out of 9.'
Wrote some notes and asked questions around the office for things I didn't catch on at first. Will finish last chapter tomorrow

Finished the last chapter on Tour of Rust, started working on a issue on GitHub project regarding x86 architecture on Tock. Wrote a basic kernel with a VGA (text) buffer and added support for simple unit tests. Installed QEMU emulator to boot the kernel on a virtual machine to test it out, and to also write via serial UART on console. Tomorrow I will move on to the next topics regarding exceptions, timeouts, etc.
