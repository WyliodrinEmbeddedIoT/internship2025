## 30 June 
- Went through tour of rust and took notes for everything i did not understand from during the semester. 
- Started working on the Rustlings exercises.

## 1 July
- Continued Rustlings but got a bit bored so started working on the labs using the STM32F4 and sucsessfully went through exercises 1-6 of lab 02.
- Found an easy tockloader issue, the Fix clippy warning: uninlined_format_args one, so decided to assign it to myself and started working on it.
> Note to self for the following days: try as hard as possible to concentrate on one thing at a time.

## 2 July
- Finished the issue and submitted a pull request.
- Continued working on the labs and managed to go through 03-05.
