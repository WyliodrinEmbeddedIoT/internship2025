## 30 June 2025
I set up the Ubuntu virtual machine and the Helix text editor. I also started the Tour of Rust.

## 1 July 2025
I completed the Tour of Rust and began working on the Rustlings exercises. I also started reviewing issues with Walid and began working on the STM labs.

## 2 July 2025
I worked on the Rustlings exercises and tried to fix one issues but it is still work in progress.

## 3 July 2025
I worked on the issue [#48](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=117935963&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C48), and got it almost done.

## 4 July 2025
Fixed the last problems with the issue and tried testing the functionality on a stm32f4, but it didnt work because the version of tock for stm32f4 doesnt have a bootloader and i need a microbit in order to test the functionality, but i dont have one and the issue was left still in review till i can get my hands on a microbit.
I also started working on another issue.

## 7 July 2025
I worked on the issue [#35](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=116462627&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C35) and finally got my hands on a microbit so i started testing the issue [#48](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=117935963&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C48), but i had some small problems with the setup.

## 8 July 2025
I worked on the issue [#35](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=116462627&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C35) and did research about it, but no significant progress was made.

## 10 July 2025
I tested again functionalities implemented in the issue [#48](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=117935963&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C48) with the help of George, but for some reason list command that should have worked doesnt, despite code being correct, so we kinda assumed there is an issue with the board.

## 11 July 2025
I again tried my luck with that board but there was no success. I dropped issue [#35](https://github.com/orgs/WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=116462627&issue=WyliodrinEmbeddedIoT%7Ctockloader-rs%7C35) and started on web based applications with tauri and vue.
