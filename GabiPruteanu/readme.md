## 1 July 2025
I completed the Tour of Rust and began working on the Rustlings exercises. I also started reviewing issues with Walid and began working on the STM labs.

## 2 July 2025
I worked on the Rustlings exercises and tried to fix one issues but it is still work in progress.

## 3 July 2025
I worked on the issue #48, and got it almost done

## 4 July 2025
Fixed the last problems with the issue and tried testing the functionality on a stm32f4, but it didnt work because the version of tock for stm32f4 doesnt have a bootloader and i need a microbit in order to test the functionality, but i dont have one and the issue was left still in review till i can get my hands on a microbit.
I also started working on another issue.

## 7 July 2025
I worked on the issue #35 and finally got my hands on a microbit so i started testing the issue #48, but i had some small problems with the setup
