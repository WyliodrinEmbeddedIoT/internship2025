Went through half of the Vue JS exercices, covered basic concepts such as reactivity and the use of `v-if`, `v-bind`, `v-on` and `v-for`.

## 26 June 2025
Finished the Vue JS exercices, delved into more complex topics like lifecycles and child components.

## 27 June 2025
Read through half of Tour of Rust. Found out some new ways to write certain pieces of code (ex. returning values, tuple-like structs) and learned about ownership and borrowing.

## 28 June 2025
Started on the rustlings exercices. Read a couple more chapters of Tour of Rust.

## 29 June 2025
Finished half of the rustlings exercices. These have been helpful in revising the material covered within Tour of Rust. 

## 30 June 2025
Cleaned around the office a little :) And more rustlings.

## 1 July 2025
Finished reading the last chapter of tour of rust. Did rustling exercices on options and error handling, which i found a litlte bit trickier. 

## 2 July 2025
Did rustlings exercices up to unit '18_iterators'.

Finished rustlings exercices at last. Started on the STM32f4 labs by setting up the board. Ran into an issue where despite our board appearing in the USB listing, the probe couldn't be found. We asked around and this problem turned out to be a pretty common one. In the end we got some help in changing the udev rules and 'Config.toml' file, which did the trick.

Looked over the labs proper. We struggled for a while on exercice 9 of 'Lab 2 - GPIO', which involved making a function that takes a letter as an argument and displays it in morse code using 3 LEDs. After much testing we realised the problem stemmed from the fact that we hadn't included a pause between displaying each dot and dash, which explained why no matter which letter we called the function for, all LEDs only lit up once, at the same time.
